Load packages

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

Read in the data

```{r, message = FALSE}
homicides_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv")
```

Clean data and create variables

```{r, message = FALSE}
homicides_df =
  homicides_df |> 
  #create city_state var, binary var whether homicide is solved, convert age to numeric
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    solved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      TRUE ~ "solved"
    ),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)
  ) |> 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL", 
         city_state != "Dallas, TX", 
         city_state != "Phoenix, AZ", 
         city_state != "Kansas City, MO",
         victim_race == "White" | victim_race == "Black")
```
